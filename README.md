# Files Opener
**Files Opener** is a simple Android app that is supposed to open the Files app included with the Android OS which doesn't show up in the launcher on some devices, especially on the newer ones.

This app itself has no UI. When opened, it simply replaces itself with the Files app. If the Files app isn't installed on the device, it shows an error message (as a [toast](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/notifiers/toasts)) and quits immediately.
